# P2P Lab

## How to try
* Build/Install the wallet. Instructions [here](./web5-wallet/README.md)
* Run Addressable DWN. Instructions [here](./addressable-dwn/README.md)
* Run Chat App (aka Dignal / 5ignal). Instructions [here](./chat-app/README.md)
* Click on the wallet action in the sidebar and create an Identity. For DWN Host Provider, put the address of the addressable dwn you just started: `http://localhost:3000`
  * _Note: in order to send messages to anyone you'll actually need to expose your DWN via `ngrok`. or piggy back on someone who's already running one that is **publicly addressable**_
  * _Note: We should really rename "Identity" to "Profile"_
  * _Note: We really need to change the Form title from "Create ION DID" to "Create Profile"_
* Pop open a browser and head to `http://localhost:5173`
* In the DWN Request Access Popup, select the Identity you just created.
* find someone to send a message to
